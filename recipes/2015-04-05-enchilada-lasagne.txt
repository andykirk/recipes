This recipe is my own invention. Well, at least, I took an Enchilada recipe from somewhere and rearranged it make assembling it easier.


Ingredients
===========

* olive oil
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2-3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1-3 tsps chilli powder to taste
* juice of 1 lime
* 2 chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 1 red pepper, sliced
* 1 can tinned tomatoes (~420g)
* ~150ml single cream
* ~50g tomato purée
* 1-2 tsp cornflour mixed with 1-2 tsp cold water (if needed)
* 8 flour tortilla wraps
* knob of butter
* ~200g cheddar cheese, grated


Instructions
============


For the sauce
-------------

1. Cook onions and garlic in the olive oil until nearly soft.
2. Add the spices and cook for 1-2 minutes.
3. Add the chicken pieces and lime juice and cook for about 10 minutes or until browned all over.
4. Add the pepper slices and cook until soft.
5. Add cream, tomatoes and tomato purée and mix well.
6. Allow to simmer about about 10 minutes, adding cornflour mix to thicken if necessary.


Meanwhile
---------

While the sauce is bubbling away, grease a lasagne dish with the butter and lay in 4 tortillas, making sure they overlap and cover the sides of the dish. Set the other 4 tortillas aside for the moment, and turn the oven on to pre-heat at gas 5.


Then
----

1. When the sauce is ready, carefully pour half of it into the lasagne dish, then lay the other tortillas on top to make a base for the second layer.
2. Pour in the remaining sauce and cover with the cheese.
3. Put in the oven for around 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted, making sure that the tortillas aren't getting burnt.
